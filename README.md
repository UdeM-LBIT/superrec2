# superrec2

superrec2 is a software package implementing several reconciliation and super-reconciliation algorithms.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository, initialize a Python virtual environment, and install the required dependencies:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/UdeM-LBIT/superrec2
$ cd superrec2
$ virtualenv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Preparing the input

To submit a reconciliation problem to one of the algorithms of this package, the first step is to prepare an input file containing the desired set of species, genes (or syntenies), and their phylogenetic trees.
Input files are JSON objects containing the following keys:

* `object_tree`: Newick string specifying the gene or synteny tree (if ancestral nodes are unnamed, they will be automatically named `O#` with indices increasing in pre-order),
* `species_tree`: Newick string specifying the species tree (if ancestral nodes are unnamed, they will be automatically named `S#` with indices increasing in pre-order),
* `leaf_object_species`: dictionary associating each leaf of the gene (or synteny) tree to its corresponding leaf species in the species tree.
* `leaf_syntenies` (optional, only for super-reconciliations): dictionary associating each leaf of the synteny tree to its corresponding synteny, specified as an array of genes.

Below is an example input for some fictional species and syntenies:

```json
{
    "object_tree": "((x_1,x_2),y_1);",
    "species_tree": "(X,Y);",
    "leaf_object_species": {
        "x_1": "X",
        "x_2": "X",
        "y_1": "Y"
    },
    "leaf_syntenies": {
        "x_1": ["g1", "g2", "g3"],
        "x_2": ["g1", "g3", "g4"],
        "y_1": ["g1", "g2", "g3", "g4"]
    }
}
```

A [complete input example including some Class-1 CRISPR-Cas systems](data/crispr-class1.in.json) is also available.
(This is the input used for the RECOMB-CGÂ 2022 publication.)

### Running a reconciliation algorithm

To run a reconciliation algorithm on a given input file, use the `./reconcile.py` program. The basic usage of the command is as follows:

```console
$ ./reconcile.py --input data/example.in.json --output example.out.json superdtl
Multifurcation resolutions: 100%|##########################################| 1/1 [00:00<00:00, 285.91it/s]
Minimum cost: 2
```

The `--input` flag specifies the path to the *input file*, and the `--output` flag specifies where to write the results.
The last argument is used to select the *reconciliation algorithm*, in this example `superdtl` (run `./reconcile.py --help` to see a list of available algorithms).
The program prints out the minimum cost of a solution and writes one of the solutions to the output file, which now contains the following object (edited for readability):

```json
{
    "input": {
        "object_tree": "((x_1,x_2)O1,y_1)O0;",
        "species_tree": "(X,Y)S0;",
        "leaf_object_species": { (repeated from above) },
        "costs": {
            "SPECIATION": 0, "DUPLICATION": 1, "HORIZONTAL_TRANSFER": 1,
            "FULL_LOSS": 1, "SEGMENTAL_LOSS": 1
        },
        "leaf_syntenies": { (repeated from above) }
    },
    "object_species": {
        "O0": "S0",
        "O1": "X",
        "x_1": "X",
        "x_2": "X",
        "y_1": "Y"
    },
    "syntenies": {
        "O0": ["g1", "g2", "g3", "g4"],
        "O1": ["g1", "g2", "g3", "g4"],
        "x_1": ["g1", "g2", "g3"],
        "x_2": ["g1", "g3", "g4"],
        "y_1": ["g1", "g2", "g3", "g4"]
    },
    "ordered": false
}
```

Of particular interest are the `object_species` key, which contains the computed reconciliation (mapping of synteny tree nodes to species tree nodes),, and the `syntenies` key, which contains the labeling of synteny tree nodes with syntenic content.

Additional options are available to generate all possible solutions and set the individual event costs (for compatible algorithms); please run `./reconcile.py --help` for details.

### Generating a reconciliation diagram from a solution

The `./draw.py` program can be used to visualize and inspect solutions generated by reconciliation algorithms.
The basic usage of the command is as follows:

```console
$ ./draw.py --input example.out.json --orientation horizontal --output example.out.pdf
```

This generates the following diagram:
